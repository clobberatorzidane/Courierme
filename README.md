# Courierme
Courierme is a shared app which enables individuals all over the world to carry stuff for strangers using airplanes to various destinations disrupting the heavy fees and taxes associated with current service providers at an affordable fee.
I am an accountant and banker from Uganda with over 8 years experience in finance, accounting, risk management and with interests in Cyber security security, blockchain technology and IT generally.
I had experienced a challenge when I purchased an item from GDGT online worth 31$ and the courier costs from the USA to Uganda were over 100$ using traditional courier companies like DHL. 
Luckily my cousin was travelling from USA to Uganda the following month and she brought it in her hand luggage. I wished there was aplatform of such goodhearted persons who could be incentivised to easily and quickly carry for other Human beings simple luggage.
The KYC Know Your Courier principles and protocals have to be in place for securing the packages plus an insurance plan.
